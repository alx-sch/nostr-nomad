""" imgs_uploader.py

Handles image uploading logic for different hosting backends such as WALA or Imgur.

Currently supports:
- Uploading images to a WALA server using SHA-256 content-addressing.
- Future support for Imgur and other platforms can be added here.

This module is used by `handle_imgs()` to upload images after downloading and caching them.
