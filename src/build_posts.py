"""build_posts.py

Module for building Post objects from Substack export data.

This script reads metadata from a posts.csv file and corresponding HTML content files,
removes duplicated image URLs, builds Post objects, processes images (including optional
upload to new image hosts), and constructs either short-form or long-form content depending
on the user's chosen event type.

Functions:
- build_posts: Main entry point for parsing and building posts.
- get_html_content: Retrieves and cleans HTML content for each post.
- remove_img_duplicate: Cleans HTML by unwrapping <a> tags around images.
